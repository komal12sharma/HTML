Since the 19th century, Louis Vuitton trunks have been made by hand. Contemporary Fashion gives a preview of the
creation of the LV trunks:
The craftsmen line up the leather and canvas, tapping in the tiny nails one by one and securing the five-letter solid
pick-proof brass locks with an individual handmade key, designed to allow the traveler to have only one key for all of
his or her luggage. The wooden frames of each trunk are made of 30-year-old poplar that has been allowed to dry for at
least four years. Each trunk has a serial number and can take up to 60 hours to make, and a suitcase as many as 15
hours.></main> <br>
